# 🌐 Devlinks App

I have developed a fullstack application named **Devlinks** using **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **TailwindCSS**. The application is fully functional and has passed all tests successfully.

## ✨ Features
- **Fully Responsive Design** 📱: Ensures optimal viewing experience across all devices.
- **User Authentication & Profile Management** 🔐: Supports user login, registration, and profile information storage.
- **Realtime Database Integration** ⚡: Enables instant communication and securely stores all changes in the database.
- **Optimized SSR and CSR** 🚀: Implements Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for the best performance.
- **Enhanced User Interaction** 🎨: Incorporates design initiatives to improve user engagement where necessary.

## 📄 Project Description
Users can create their profiles, add and remove links, and rearrange them using a drag-and-drop feature. They can also personalize their profile by adding their name, surname, profile picture, and email address. 

Once all changes are made, users can click the "Preview" button at the top right corner to see their modifications live via a unique URL. On the preview page, users can click the "Share Link" button at the top right to share their personalized link with the world permanently.
